#  AdoptMe Landing Page

This is my **first HTML & CSS project**, built while learning web development.

It’s a simple and clean landing page for a fictional pet adoption website — **AdoptMe.com** — showcasing two adorable pets: Jerry (a dog) and Tom (a cat), with their images and descriptions.



##  Features

- Simple layout  
- Pet profile cards with images and descriptions  
- Built entirely using **HTML** and **CSS**  
- Good project to practice layout, structure, and styling



## What I Learned

- How to write clean HTML structure  
- Styling with CSS (fonts, layout, cards)  
- Use of `div`, `class`, and `id` effectively  
- Creating a full webpage from scratch
